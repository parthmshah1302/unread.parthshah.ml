1. If a friend of mine had a "personality conflict" with a mutual acquaintance of ours with whom
   it was important for him/her to get along, I would:

   - 4A. Tell my friend that I felt s/he was partially responsible for any problems with this
     other person and try to let him/her know how the person was being affected by
     him/her.

   - 1B. Not get involved because I wouldn't be able to continue to get along with both of
     them once I had entered in any way.

2. If one of my friends and I had a heated argument in the past and I realized that s/he was ill at
   ease around me from that time on, I would:
   - 2A. Avoid making things worse by discussing his/her behavior and just let the whole
     thing drop.
   - 3B. Bring up his/her behavior and ask him/her how s/he felt the argument had affected
     our relationship.
3. If a friend began to avoid me and act in an aloof and withdrawn manner, I would:
   - 4A. Tell him/her about his/her behavior and suggest that s/he tell me what was on his/her
     mind.
   - 1B. Follow his/her lead and keep our contact brief and aloof since that seems to be what
     s/he wants.
4. If two of my friends and I were talking and one of my friends slipped and brought up a personal
   problem of mine that involved the other friend, of which s/he was not yet aware, I would:
   - 5A. Change the subject and signal my friend to do the same.
   - 0B. Fill my uniformed friend in on what the other friend was talking about and suggest
     that we go into it later.
5. If a friend of mine were to tell me that, in his/her opinion, I was doing things that made me
   less effective than I might be in social situations, I would:
   - 3A. Ask him/her to spell out or describe what s/he has observed and suggest changes I
     might make.
   - 2B. Resent his/her criticism and let him/her know why I behave the way I do.
6. If one of my friends aspired to an office in our organisation for which I felt s/he was unqualified, and
   if s/he had been tentatively assigned to that position by the leader of our group, I would:
   - 1A. Not mention my misgivings to either my friend or the leader of our group and let
     them handle it in their own way.
   - 4B. Tell my friend and the leader of our group of my misgivings and then leave the final
     decision up to them.
7. If I felt that one of my friends was being unfair to me and his/her other friends, but none of
   them had mentioned anything about it, I would:
   - 3A. Ask several of these people how they perceived the situation to see if they felt s/he
     was being unfair.
   - 2B. Not ask the others how they perceived our friend, but wait for them to bring it up with
     me.
8. If I were preoccupied with some personal matters and a friend told me that I had become irritated
   with him/her and others and that I was jumping on him/her for unimportant things, I would:
   - 5A. Tell him/her I was preoccupied and would probably be on edge for a while and would
     prefer not to be bothered.
   - 0B. Listen to his/her complaints but not try to explain my actions to him/her.
9. If I had heard some friends discussing an ugly rumor about a friend of mine which I knew
   could hurt him/her and s/he asked me what I knew about it, if anything, I would:
   - 2A. Say I didn't know anything about it and tell him/her no one would believe a rumor
     like that anyway.
   - 3B. Tell him/her exactly what I had heard, when I had heard it, and from whom I had
     heard it.
10. If a friend pointed out the fact that I had a personality conflict with another friend with whom
    it was important for me to get along, I would:
    - 0A. Consider his/her comments out of line and tell him/her I didn't want to discuss the
      matter any further.
    - 5B. Talk about it openly with him/her to find out how my behavior was being affected by
      this.
11. If my relationship with a friend has been damaged by repeated arguments on an issue
    of importance to us both, I would:
    - 0A. Be cautious in my conversations with him/her so the issue would not come up again
      to worsen our relationship.
    - 5B. Point to the problems the controversy was causing in our relationship and suggest that
      we discuss it until we get it resolved.
12. If in a personal discussion with a friend about his/her problems and behavior s/he
    suddenly suggested we discuss my problems and behavior as well as his/her own, I would:
    - 0A. Try to keep the discussion away from me by suggesting that other, closer friends
      often talked to me about such matters.
    - 5B. Welcome the opportunity to hear what s/he felt about me and encourage his/her
      comments.
13. If a friend of mine began to tell me about his/her hostile feelings about another friend whom s/he
    felt was being unkind to others (and I agreed wholeheartedly), I would:
    - 4A. Listen and also express my own feelings to me/her so s/he would know where I
      stood.
    - 1B. Listen, but not express my own negative views and opinion because s/he might repeat
      what I said to him/her in confidence.
14. If I thought an ugly rumor was being spread about me and suspected that one of my friends had
    quite likely heard it, I would:
    - 3A. Avoid mentioning the issue and leave it to him/her to tell me about it if s/he wanted
      to.
    - 2B. Risk putting him/her on the spot by asking him/her directly what s/he knew about the
      whole thing.
15. If I had observed a friend in social situations and thought that s/he was doing a number of
    things which hurt his/her relationships, I would:
    - 4A. Risk being seen as a busy body and tell him/her what I had observed and my
      reactions to it.
    - 1B. Keep my opinion to myself rather than be seen as interfering in things that are none
      of my business.
16. If two friends and I were talking and one of them inadvertently mentioned a personal problem
    which involved me, but of which I knew nothing, I would:
    - 3A. Press them for information about the problem and their opinions about it.
    - 2B. Leave it up to my friends to tell me or not tell me, letting them change the subject if
      they wished.
17. If a friend seemed to be preoccupied and began to jump on me for seemingly unimportant
    things, and became irritated with me and others without real cause, I would:
    - 3A. Treat him/her with kid gloves for awhile on the assumption that s/he was having
      some temporary personal problems which were none of my business.
    - 2B. Try to talk to him/her about it and point out to him/her how his/her behavior was
      affecting people.
18. If I had begun to dislike certain habits of a friend to the point that it was interfering with
    my enjoying his/her company, I would:
    - 0A. Say nothing to him/her directly, but let him/her know my feelings by ignoring
      him/her whenever his/her annoying habits were obvious.
    - 5B. Get my feelings out in the open and clear the air so that we could continue our
      friendship comfortably and enjoyably.
19. In discussing social behavior with one of my more sensitive friends, I would:

    - 3B. Focus on his/her flaws and weaknesses so s/he could improve his/her interpersonal
      skills.
20. If I knew I might be assigned to an important position in our group and my friends' attitudes
    toward me had become rather negative, I would:

    - 4B. Try to figure out my own shortcomings by myself so I could improve.
