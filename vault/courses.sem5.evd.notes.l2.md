# What are the criteria for selecting microcontroller

- Computational Need
- Availibilty of Software Development Tools
- Reliable sources of microcotrollers

## Computing need

- 8-bit vs 16-bit vs 32-bit
  - But what does it mean?
  - Number of bits it can process at a single time
- Power consumption
- Amount of RAM and ROM
- Number of I/O Pins
- Number of Timers

## Availibility of SD Tools

- Assembles
- Debbuger
- Code efficient C Language Compiler
- Technical Support
- In-house and outside expertise

## Sources

- Intel vs AMD

# Little history about microcontrollers

- Harvard Architecture vs Princeton Architecture (von Neumann)
- Seperate Program and Data Memory Interface in Harvard Architecture
- [CISC vs RISC](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-organization-risc-and-cisc/) Processors

  - Complex vs Reduced (Instruction Set Computing)

  - ![](/assets/images/2021-08-20-11-53-43.png)
  - AVR Family has the range from 8 to 32 bit RISC MCU

  * 16 to 32 Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS) and pin counts from 8 to 100 pins

* If you put 0 in any pin, it is defined as 0 
* If you put 1 in any pin, it is defined as 1
