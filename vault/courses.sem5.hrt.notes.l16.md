## Fresco Painting

- Arriccio - Rough plaster
- Intonaco - Fine Plaster

## Difference between Fresco Buono and Fresco Secco

- Apply when the plaster is wet vs apply when plaster is dry respectively
- In buono, adhesive is not added with pigment
- In secco, lime water acts as adhesive; Ali - gila technique in Rajasthan

## How does the pigment stay on wall for centuries? (Fresco Secco)

- Wet wall -> Live plaster
- Ca(OH)2 captures CO2 from atmosphere and turns into calcium carbonate
- This is limestone (thin film)

## Physical and Chemical Deterioration of Heritage materials

- Crumbling or tearing of paper - Physical change

## Deterioration in stone

### Surface abrasion - Any scratch on stone surface

- Sand and dirt particles are angular in shape - sharp corners

### Erosion - Carved structure flattened due to wind

- Nose flattened out is an example

### Salt Crystallisation - Huge problem

- Salts are generally in liquid (dissolved) form
- Through capillary actions, salts reaches high up on the all of the structure - as all walls are porous in nature
- As salts quickly get dissolved in water - salts ionized quickly
- Salts flow within pored of the wall - and water evaporates
  - It tries to expand the volume of the wall
  - This shrinkage and expansion causes the plaster to crack and deteriorate

### Exfoliation - Characteristic feature fo sandstone

- Sandstone is a layerified structure
- Salts flow inside the wall - as they are porous
- Evaporation takes place on the exterieoir part of the wall
- Salts accumulate on the external layer and crystallizes
- What can be the consequence?
  - Salt will expand teh volume
  - The external layer will fall
- External layer detaches, and this process is called as exfoliation
- It is termed as seperation of layers
- _Slide from class_

### Leaching of marble surface

- CaCO3 reacts with Acid rain and leaches out
- What is Acid Rain?
  - Nitric Acid and Sulphuric Acid are formed
  - Moisture from air combines with NO2 and SO2 to form HNO3 and H2SO4 respectively
  - Water combines with CO2 to also form Carbonic Acid (H2CO3)
- $CaCO3 + H2SO4 \rightarrow CaSO4 + H2CO3$
- All surface details are lost
- _Slide_

## Deterioration in Ceramics

- ![](</assets/images/![](/assets/images/2021-12-03-20-34-23.png).png>)
- Generally are very porous materials
- What does the porosity depend on?
  - Inversely proportinal to heating (more heating, less porosity)
- Frost damage - also due to porosity in ceramics
