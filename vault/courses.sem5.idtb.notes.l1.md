* We do not understand situations that we are using in our everyday life
## Schools of Psychology 
* Structuralism 
  * You break down anything to it's constituent elements 
  * To study mind, we break it down into smaller parts (through introspection)
  * Introspection: Objectively examine your thoughts and break it down 
  ### Problem with this method
  * It does not tell us how mind functions, even if we have broken it down to it's elements
