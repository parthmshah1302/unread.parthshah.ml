## What is Crystal Lattice?

- Only the geometric properties of the crystal are of interest; replace each atom by a geometrical point located at the equilibrium position of that atom.
- **Lattice** are the geometric points which are arranged regularly in a periodic fashion

## Unit Cells
* Representative unit of the structure
* Term unit should not be used with having one lattice point (primitive or simple would be used for that)

* 2D Unit Cells

## Crystal Structure and Crystal Lattice
* Crystal Lattice plus Basis is Crystal Structure

## Co-ordination Number
* (For Bravais Lattice): The number of lattice points closest to a given point 
* All lattice points have the same number of nearest neighbours or coordination number 
* 6 for Simple cubic ($a$)
* 8 for Body Centered ($a\sqrt{3}\over{2}$)
* 12 for Face Centered ($a\over{\sqrt{2}}$)
## Atomic Packing factor 
* $$
  APF = {\text{Volume of Atoms in Unit Cell}\over{\text{Volume of Unit Cell}}}
  $$
* Volume of unit cell is $a^3$
## Simple Cubic 
* Only adjacent atoms are touching 
## Body Centered Cube
* 2 total atoms in one unit cell
