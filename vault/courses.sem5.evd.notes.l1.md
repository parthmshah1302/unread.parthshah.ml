##  Two categories of Products 
* System performance critical - **Microprocessor**
* Issues of space, power and rapid development critical - **Microcontroller**

##  But first, what is a system? 
* A way of working, organizing and performing tasks according to a fixed set of rules, program or plan. 
* Democratic governments and Human Nervous System are examples 
## What are embedded systems? 
* We need to understand the microprocessor and microcontroller first  
* An embedded system is a system that has 
  * Software embedded into the computer hardware
  * Thus makes the system dedicated for an application or purpose 
* _An embedded system is one that has a dedicated purpose software embedded in a computer hardware_
## Stand alone embedded systems
* It is designed to perform a very specific task repetitively 
* These type of systems are non-reactive to the environment (ECG)
* Simplest form of system (Biometric attendance system)
## Real-time embedded systems 
* A real-time embedded system usually monitors the environment where the system is installed 
* Temperature controller and Aircraft engine controller are examples 
## Remote controlled embedded systems 
* Designed to be reactive or non-reactive to its environment 
* Built using speciallised communication systems 
* Drones are an example 
## Mobile embedded systems 
* Designed to be continuously on the move
* Mobiles are an example 
## General Architecture

## Components of embedded systems 
* Hardware
* Software 
* Firmware 
## Software vs Firmware
* Generally fixed, usually small programs and data structures that internally controlls various electronic devices are firmware
* Higher level programs that can be changed without replacing hardware are software
* _Software that is connected to specific hardware and if the hardware cannot function without that software, it is known as the firmware_
