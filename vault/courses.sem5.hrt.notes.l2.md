## Tangible vs Intangible Heritage

- Tangible Heritage is something we can touch
  - Monuments
- Intangible Heritage is something you cannot touch
  - Music, Danceforms

  - First from the the right is one of the best stone sculpture in India, located in Patna Museum
  - It has a mirror finish
  - It belongs to 2nd-3rd Century BC

## Things to understand while selecting a material

- Property of the material
- Behaviour of the material
- Formation of stone

## Observing two sculptures

![](/assets/images/2021-08-19-08-24-46.png)

- Both of them are pot bellied
- The bellies is darker in both sculptures
- Whenever people visit the sculpture, they tend to brush their hands to the belly
- Our hands have certain oils that keep them flexible
- And oil passes in the sculpture

## What are Rocks?

- Outer layer of Earth's crust is known as **rock**
- The moment you detach the piece of rock, it becomes a **stone**
- Monomineralistic and Polymineralistic are divisions on basis of number of minerals
- Types of Rocks
  - Igneous
    - ![](/assets/images/2021-08-19-09-00-25.png)
    - Molten rock that cools and hardens
    - ![](/assets/images/2021-08-19-08-37-09.png)
    - Extrusive igneous rocks: Lava that is formed outside
    - Intrusive igneous rocks: Formed inside the Earth
    - Intrusive is _more compact_ as they are quickly cooled
    - Extrusive rocks pack lot of air and gases, thus the porous/coarse structure
    - Granite is the most abundant igneous rock (made up of feldspar, quartz, mica, hornblende)
      - Quartz is a highly-crystalline mineral, and it helps to maintain sharp angles of [clocks](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/quartzclockwatch.html)
  - Sedimentary
    - ![](/assets/images/2021-08-19-09-04-24.png)
    - Forms sediments that are cemented together
    - Sediments come from pre-existing rocks
    - Weathering and erosion causes this weathering
    - **Clay** is the final product of the weathering of a rock
    - Sandstone is made up of Sand
    - Sandstone, Limestone and Conglomerate _mechanically_ formed sedimentary rocks 
    - Rocksalt (or evaporites) and Iron Ore are _chemically_ formed
    - Coal is _organically_ formed
    - ![](/assets/images/2021-08-19-09-16-46.png) 
  - Metamorphic
    - Formed by effect of heat and pressure on existing rocks 
    - Greatly affects the hardness, texture or layer patterns 
    - Types of Metamorphic rocks 
      - Regional Metamorphic Rock
      - Contact Metamorphic Rock
    - Marble (from Calcite)
      - Monomineralicistic - Only Calcite ($\text{CaCO{\scriptscriptstyle 3})}$
      - 
    - Gneiss (from Granite)
  
# Summary

- _Tangible is heritage you can touch, intangible is what you cannot_
- _Property, behaviour and formation of a stone are the steps_
- _Rocks are attached to the Earth, Stones are detached to the Earth_
- _Igneous, Sedimentary and Metamorphic rocks are the three types of rocks_
- _Extrusive - Intrusive nature determines the properties_
- _Sedimentary rocks are formed by Sediment, Compaction and Cementation_
- _Metamorphic rocks are formed from pre-existing rocks_
