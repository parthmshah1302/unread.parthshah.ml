as it is a software in the bigger picture_ \r\n* OS gives up and regains control to the processor whenever needed\r\n\r\n# Summary \r\n_Program execution in a coputer system - OS is the intermediary - Process Memory I/O and File Management - Convinience, efficieny and evolve are objectives - **Services provided by any operating system:** Program development, program execution, Access to I/O Devices, Controlled access to files, System access, Error detection and accounting - OS as a resource manager _\r\n\r\n## [Lecture recording ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IRzVAAOQS2_RbwC16BMQBWsX813Ikxrw/view?usp=sharing)","url":"https://unread.parthshah.ml/notes\\HwR0cuHxotpiqksRauh5F.html","relUrl":"notes\\HwR0cuHxotpiqksRauh5F.html"},{"doc":"Lab","title":"Lab","hpath":"courses.sem5.os.lab","content":"\r\n","url":"https://unread.parthshah.ml/notes\\Oq8O2HrTTO85jbxalzXOf.html","relUrl":"notes\\Oq8O2HrTTO85jbxalzXOf.html"},{"doc":"Lab 3","title":"Lab 3","hpath":"courses.sem5.os.lab.3","content":"\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-09-09-14-45-25.png)\r\n\r\n# Q1\r\n```bash\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\r\n# Parth Shah AU1940065\r\ncat << \"EOF\"\r\n\r\n██████╗  █████╗ ██████╗ ████████╗██╗  ██╗    ███████╗██╗  ██╗ █████╗ ██╗  ██╗    \r\n██╔══██╗██╔══██╗██╔══██╗╚══██╔══╝██║  ██║    ██╔════╝██║  ██║██╔══██╗██║  ██║    \r\n██████╔╝███████║██████╔╝   ██║   ███████║    ███████╗███████║███████║███████║    \r\n██╔═══╝ ██╔══██║██╔══██╗   ██║   ██╔══██║    ╚════██║██╔══██║██╔══██║██╔══██║    \r\n██║     ██║  ██║██║  ██║   ██║   ██║  ██║    ███████║██║  ██║██║  ██║██║  ██║    \r\n╚═╝     ╚═╝  ╚═╝╚═╝  ╚═╝   ╚═╝   ╚═╝  ╚═╝    ╚══════╝╚═╝  ╚═╝╚═╝  ╚═╝╚═╝  ╚═╝    \r\n                                                                                 \r\n █████╗ ██╗   ██╗ ██╗ █████╗ ██╗  ██╗ ██████╗  ██████╗  ██████╗ ███████╗         \r\n██╔══██╗██║   ██║███║██╔══██╗██║  ██║██╔═████╗██╔═████╗██╔════╝ ██╔════╝         \r\n███████║██║   ██║╚██║╚██████║███████║██║██╔██║██║██╔██║███████╗ ███████╗         \r\n██╔══██║██║   ██║ ██║ ╚═══██║╚════██║████╔╝██║████╔╝██║██╔═══██╗╚════██║         \r\n██║  ██║╚██████╔╝ ██║ █████╔╝     ██║╚██████╔╝╚██████╔╝╚██████╔╝███████║         \r\n╚═╝  ╚═╝ ╚═════╝  ╚═╝ ╚════╝      ╚═╝ ╚═════╝  ╚═════╝  ╚═════╝ ╚══════╝         \r\n                                                                                 \r\n\r\nEOF\r\nDIR=\"/home/parth/Desktop/Code/OS-Labs/Lab3/\"\r\nif [ -d \"$DIR\" ];

Say I didn't know anything about it and tell him/her no one would believe a rumor\r\n     like that anyway.\r\n   - 3B. Tell him/her exactly what I had heard, when I had heard it, and from whom I had\r\n     heard it.\r\n10. If a friend pointed out the fact that I had a personality conflict with another friend with whom\r\n    it was important for me to get along, I would:\r\n    - 0A. Consider his/her comments out of line and tell him/her I didn't want to discuss the\r\n      matter any further.\r\n    - 5B. Talk about it openly with him/her to find out how my behavior was being affected by\r\n      this.\r\n11. If my relationship with a friend has been damaged by repeated arguments on an issue\r\n    of importance to us both, I would:\r\n    - 0A. Be cautious in my conversations with him/her so the issue would not come up again\r\n      to worsen our relationship.\r\n    - 5B. Point to the problems the controversy was causing in our relationship and suggest that\r\n      we discuss it until we get it resolved.\r\n12. If in a personal discussion with a friend about his/her problems and behavior s/he\r\n    suddenly suggested we discuss my problems and behavior as well as his/her own, I would:\r\n    - 0A. Try to keep the discussion away from me by suggesting that other, closer friends\r\n      often talked to me about such matters.\r\n    - 5B. Welcome the opportunity to hear what s/he felt about me and encourage his/her\r\n      comments.\r\n13. If a friend of mine began to tell me about his/her hostile feelings about another friend whom s/he\r\n    felt was being unkind to others (and I agreed wholeheartedly), I would:\r\n    - 4A. Listen and also express my own feelings to me/her so s/he would know where I\r\n      stood.\r\n    - 1B. Listen, but not express my own negative views and opinion because s/he might repeat\r\n      what I said to him/her in confidence.\r\n14. If I thought an ugly rumor was being spread about me and suspected that one of my friends had\r\n    quite likely heard it, I would:\r\n    - 3A. Avoid mentioning the issue and leave it to him/her to tell me about it if s/he wanted\r\n      to.\r\n    - 2B. Risk putting him/her on the spot by asking him/her directly what s/he knew about the\r\n      whole thing.\r\n15. If I had observed a friend in social situations and thought that s/he was doing a number of\r\n    things which hurt his/her relationships, I would:\r\n    - 4A. Risk being seen as a busy body and tell him/her what I had observed and my\r\n      reactions to it.\r\n    - 1B. Keep my opinion to myself rather than be seen as interfering in things that are none\r\n      of my business.\r\n16. If two friends and I were talking and one of them inadvertently mentioned a personal problem\r\n    which involved me, but of which I knew nothing, I would:\r\n    - 3A. Press them for information about the problem and their opinions about it.\r\n    - 2B. Leave it up to my friends to tell me or not tell me, letting them change the subject if\r\n      they wished.\r\n17. If a friend seemed to be preoccupied and began to jump on me for seemingly unimportant\r\n    things, and became irritated with me and others without real cause, I would:\r\n    - 3A. Treat him/her with kid gloves for awhile on the assumption that s/he was having\r\n      some temporary personal problems which were none of my business.\r\n    - 2B. Try to talk to him/her about it and point out to him/her how his/her behavior was\r\n      affecting people.\r\n18. If I had begun to dislike certain habits of a friend to the point that it was interfering with\r\n    my enjoying his/her company, I would:\r\n    - 0A. Say nothing to him/her directly, but let him/her know my feelings by ignoring\r\n      him/her whenever his/her annoying habits were obvious.\r\n    - 5B. Get my feelings out in the open and clear the air so that we could continue our\r\n      friendship comfortably and enjoyably.\r\n19. In discussing social behavior with one of my more sensitive friends, I would:\r\n    - 2A. Avoid mentioning his/her flaws and weaknesses so as not to hurt his/her feelings.\r\n    - 3B. Focus on his/her flaws and weaknesses so s/he could improve his/her interpersonal\r\n      skills.\r\n20. If I knew I might be assigned to an important position in our group and my friends' attitudes\r\n    toward me had become rather negative, I would:\r\n    - 1A. Discuss my shortcomings with my friends so I could see where to improve.\r\n    - 4B. Try to figure out my own shortcomings by myself so I could improve.\r\n\r\n## Calculating the score\r\n\r\n| Solicits Feedback | Gives Feedback |\r\n| :---------------: | :------------: |\r\n|        3         |       4       |\r\n|        4         |       0       |\r\n|        3         |       4       |\r\n|        3         |       3       |\r\n|        0         |       5       |\r\n|        5         |       4       |\r\n|        5         |       4       |\r\n|        2         |       2       |\r\n|        3         |       5       |\r\n|        1         |       3       |\r\n|        **29**         |       **34**       |\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-20-13-24-15.png)\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/2021-08-20-13-24-43.png)","url":"https://unread.parthshah.ml/notes\\0h9QZ2ftvX1tmqpS3D8W3.html","relUrl":"notes\\0h9QZ2ftvX1tmqpS3D8W3.html"},{"doc":"Heritage Conservation","title":"Heritage Conservation","hpath":"courses.sem5.hrt","content":"\n\r\n","url":"https://unread.parthshah.ml/notes\\hxLnPDNyktyNrJONhNyIu.html","relUrl":"notes\\hxLnPDNyktyNrJONhNyIu.html"},{"doc":"Notes","title":"Notes","hpath":"courses.sem5.hrt.notes","content":"\r\n","url":"https://unread.parthshah.ml/notes\\30HDwhhCUQ0lBaPFyJIFo.html","relUrl":"notes\\30HDwhhCUQ0lBaPFyJIFo.html"},{"doc":"L3 -
