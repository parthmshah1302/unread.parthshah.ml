You had to transfer the mode from user to kernel or vice-versa in the previous modes\r\n  - Communication takes place using message passing\r\n  - Easier to extend, as kernel mode is not to be chanced\r\n  - Easier to port the OS to new architecture (Only work on Kernel mode; user mode would be fine)\r\n  - More reliable (as less code in Kernel mode)\r\n  - More secure (as less code has to be validated in Kernel mode)\r\n- Disadvantages:\r\n  - Performance overhead of user to kernel communications\r\n- Mach, MINIX and Windows NT Client-Server are some examples\r\n  \r\n# Summary \r\n_Serial processing (Single job) - Simple batch system (Monitor acts as interaction) -

If a friend of mine had a \"personality conflict\" with a mutual acquaintance of ours with whom\r\n   it was important for him/her to get along, I would:\r\n\r\n   - 4A. Tell my friend that I felt s/he was partially responsible for any problems with this\r\n     other person and try to let him/her know how the person was being affected by\r\n     him/her.\r\n\r\n   - 1B. Not get involved because I wouldn't be able to continue to get along with both of\r\n     them once I had entered in any way.\r\n\r\n2. If one of my friends and I had a heated argument in the past and I realized that s/he was ill at\r\n   ease around me from that time on, I would:\r\n   - 2A. Avoid making things worse by discussing his/her behavior and just let the whole\r\n     thing drop.\r\n   - 3B. Bring up his/her behavior and ask him/her how s/he felt the argument had affected\r\n     our relationship.\r\n3. If a friend began to avoid me and act in an aloof and withdrawn manner, I would:\r\n   - 4A. Tell him/her about his/her behavior and suggest that s/he tell me what was on his/her\r\n     mind.\r\n   - 1B. Follow his/her lead and keep our contact brief and aloof since that seems to be what\r\n     s/he wants.\r\n4. If two of my friends and I were talking and one of my friends slipped and brought up a personal\r\n   problem of mine that involved the other friend, of which s/he was not yet aware, I would:\r\n   - 5A. Change the subject and signal my friend to do the same.\r\n   - 0B. Fill my uniformed friend in on what the other friend was talking about and suggest\r\n     that we go into it later.\r\n5. If a friend of mine were to tell me that, in his/her opinion, I was doing things that made me\r\n   less effective than I might be in social situations, I would:\r\n   - 3A. Ask him/her to spell out or describe what s/he has observed and suggest changes I\r\n     might make.\r\n   - 2B. Resent his/her criticism and let him/her know why I behave the way I do.\r\n6. If one of my friends aspired to an office in our organisation for which I felt s/he was unqualified, and\r\n   if s/he had been tentatively assigned to that position by the leader of our group, I would:\r\n   - 1A. Not mention my misgivings to either my friend or the leader of our group and let\r\n     them handle it in their own way.\r\n   - 4B. Tell my friend and the leader of our group of my misgivings and then leave the final\r\n     decision up to them.\r\n7. If I felt that one of my friends was being unfair to me and his/her other friends, but none of\r\n   them had mentioned anything about it, I would:\r\n   - 3A. Ask several of these people how they perceived the situation to see if they felt s/he\r\n     was being unfair.\r\n   - 2B. Not ask the others how they perceived our friend, but wait for them to bring it up with\r\n     me.\r\n8. If I were preoccupied with some personal matters and a friend told me that I had become irritated\r\n   with him/her and others and that I was jumping on him/her for unimportant things, I would:\r\n   - 5A. Tell him/her I was preoccupied and would probably be on edge for a while and would\r\n     prefer not to be bothered.\r\n   - 0B. Listen to his/her complaints but not try to explain my actions to him/her.\r\n9. If I had heard some friends discussing an ugly rumor about a friend of mine which I knew\r\n   could hurt him/her and s/he asked me what I knew about it, if anything, I would:\r\n   - 2A. Say I didn't know anything about it and tell him/her no one would believe a rumor\r\n     like that anyway.\r\n   - 3B. Tell him/her exactly what I had heard, when I had heard it, and from whom I had\r\n     heard it.\r\n10. If a friend pointed out the fact that I had a personality conflict with another friend with whom\r\n    it was important for me to get along, I would:\r\n    - 0A. Consider his/her comments out of line and tell him/her I didn't want to discuss the\r\n      matter any further.\r\n    - 5B. Talk about it openly with him/her to find out how my behavior was being affected by\r\n      this.\r\n11. If my relationship with a friend has been damaged by repeated arguments on an issue\r\n    of importance to us both, I would:\r\n    - 0A. Be cautious in my conversations with him/her so the issue would not come up again\r\n      to worsen our relationship.\r\n    - 5B. Point to the problems the controversy was causing in our relationship and suggest that\r\n      we discuss it until we get it resolved.\r\n12. If in a personal discussion with a friend about his/her problems and behavior s/he\r\n    suddenly suggested we discuss my problems and behavior as well as his/her own, I would:\r\n    - 0A. Try to keep the discussion away from me by suggesting that other, closer friends\r\n      often talked to me about such matters.\r\n    - 5B. Welcome the opportunity to hear what s/he felt about me and encourage his/her\r\n      comments.\r\n13. If a friend of mine began to tell me about his/her hostile feelings about another friend whom s/he\r\n    felt was being unkind to others (and I agreed wholeheartedly), I would:\r\n    - 4A. Listen and also express my own feelings to me/her so s/he would know where I\r\n      stood.\r\n    - 1B. Listen, but not express my own negative views and opinion because s/he might repeat\r\n      what I said to him/her in confidence.\r\n14. If I thought an ugly rumor was being spread about me and suspected that one of my friends had\r\n    quite likely heard it, I would:\r\n    - 3A. Avoid mentioning the issue and leave it to him/her to tell me about it if s/he wanted\r\n      to.\r\n    - 2B. Risk putting him/her on the spot by asking him/her directly what s/he knew about the\r\n      whole thing.\r\n15. If I had observed a friend in social situations and thought that s/he was doing a number of\r\n    things which hurt his/her relationships, I would:\r\n    - 4A. Risk being seen as a busy body and tell him/her what I had observed and my\r\n      reactions to it.\r\n    - 1B. Keep my opinion to myself rather than be seen as interfering in things that are none\r\n      of my business.\r\n16. If two friends and I were talking and one of them inadvertently mentioned a personal problem\r\n    which involved me, but of which I knew nothing, I would:\r\n    - 3A. Press them for information about the problem and their opinions about it.\r\n    - 2B. Leave it up to my friends to tell me or not tell me, letting them change the subject if\r\n      they wished.\r\n17. If a friend seemed to be preoccupied and began to jump on me for seemingly unimportant\r\n    things, and became irritated with me and others without real cause, I would:\r\n    - 3A. Treat him/her with kid gloves for awhile on the assumption that s/he was having\r\n      some temporary personal problems which were none of my business.\r\n    - 2B. Try to talk to him/her about it and point out to him/her how his/her behavior was\r\n      affecting people.\r\n18. If I had begun to dislike certain habits of a friend to the point that it was interfering with\r\n    my enjoying his/her company, I would:\r\n    - 0A. Say nothing to him/her directly, but let him/her know my feelings by ignoring\r\n      him/her whenever his/her annoying habits were obvious.\r\n    - 5B. Get my feelings out in the open and clear the air so that we could continue our\r\n      friendship comfortably and enjoyably.\r\n19. In discussing social behavior with one of my more sensitive friends, I would:\r\n    - 2A. Avoid mentioning his/her flaws and weaknesses so as not to hurt his/her feelings.\r\n    - 3B. Focus on his/her flaws and weaknesses so s/he could improve his/her interpersonal\r\n      skills.\r\n20.

Igneous\r\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-08-19-09-00-25.png)\r\n    - Molten rock that cools and hardens\r\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-08-19-08-37-09.png)\r\n    - Extrusive igneous rocks: Lava that is formed outside\r\n    - Intrusive igneous rocks: Formed inside the Earth\r\n    - Intrusive is _more compact_ as they are quickly cooled\r\n    - Extrusive rocks pack lot of air and gases, thus the porous/coarse structure\r\n    - Granite is the most abundant igneous rock (made up of feldspar, quartz, mica, hornblende)\r\n      - Quartz is a highly-crystalline mineral, and it helps to maintain sharp angles of [clocks](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/quartzclockwatch.html)\r\n  - Sedimentary\r\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-08-19-09-04-24.png)\r\n    - Forms sediments that are cemented together\r\n    - Sediments come from pre-existing rocks\r\n    - Weathering and erosion causes this weathering\r\n    - **Clay** is the final product of the weathering of a rock\r\n    - Sandstone is made up of Sand\r\n    - Sandstone, Limestone and Conglomerate _mechanically_ formed sedimentary rocks \r\n    - Rocksalt (or evaporites) and Iron Ore are _chemically_ formed\r\n    - Coal is _organically_ formed\r\n    - ![](/assets/images/2021-08-19-09-16-46.png) \r\n  - Metamorphic\r\n    - Formed by effect of heat and pressure on existing rocks \r\n    - Greatly affects the hardness, texture or layer patterns \r\n    -

Executes instruction from the memory containing the monitor\n  - **Control is passed to a job** means processor is fetching and executing\n  - **Control is returning a job** means the monitor is handling the program\n\n## Job Control Language (JCL)\n\n- Language that provides instruction to the monitor\n- It decides what compiler to use\n\n## Modes of Operation\n\n- User Mode\n  - User program executes here\n  - Certain areas of memory protected from user access (cannot access the entire memory)\n  - Certain instructions may not be executed\n- Kernel Mode\n  - [Kernel](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-a-kernel-7c532d5d3e56?gi=ca786d908474): Core of an Operating System\n  - Monitor program executes in Kernel Mode\n  - Privileged instructions may be executed, all memory accesible\n  - Sudo is Kernel mode\n  - But even in sudo, you are in user mode with permissions; and the implementation is done in Kernel mode\n- When you are typing or trying to open a file with your program, it creates an interrupt. There is an I/O wait as file is loaded from the secondary memory and after the file is ready, interrupt is sent. The interrupt can only be handled in Kernel mode\n- [**(Imp)** Kernel Mode vs sudo](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21761185/is-there-a-difference-between-sudo-mode-and-kernel-mode#:~:text=Yes%2C%20a%20huge%20difference%20between%20sudo%20and%20kernel%20mode.)\n- User program is any program that you want to run except OS programs (cannot manipulate the hardware)\n- [User Mode vs Kernel Mode](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user-mode-and-kernel-mode-switching/#:~:text=The%20User%20mode%20is%20normal,like%20hardware%2C%20memory%2C%20etc.&text=System%20Calls%20are%20the%20only,kernel%20mode%20from%20user%20mode.)\n\n## Issue with Simple Batch System\n\n- Differs from Serial Processing due to the presence of a monitor in between\n- CPU is often idle\n  - Even with automatic job sequencing\n  - Processor speed is very high than I/O Device speed (Memory or Hard Disk Speed)\n  - ![Processor vs I/O Speed](/assets/images/2021-08-18-08-42-39.png)\n  - _When you are reading or writing, your processor is idle_\n\n## Uniprogramming\n\n- Processor must wait for I/O before proceeding\n- ![Uniprogramming](/assets/images/2021-08-18-08-46-14.png)\n- The processor time is wasted during the _Wait_ time periods\n\n## Multiprogramming\n\n- Processor switches to another job when it is waiting\n- ![Multiprogramming](/assets/images/2021-08-18-08-48-09.png)\n- As this is the batch system, you cannot interact with the job; no user interaction\n\n## Time Sharing Systems\n\n- Can be used to handle multiple interactive jobs\n- Processor time is shared among multiple users\n- Multiple users simultaneously access the system through different terminals\n- OS interleaves the execution of each user program in a _short burst_ of quantum or computation\n- The same computer is being shared through different terminals\n\n## Batch Multiprogramming vs Time Sharing\n\n- ![Batch Multiprogramming vs Time Sharing](/assets/images/2021-08-18-08-57-51.png)\n- Response time is very important in interactive programs\n- Automated Mode vs Interactive Mode\n\n## Operating System Stucture\n\n- General purpose OS is a very large software\n- Modularity and Information hiding apply under principles of good ssoftware development\n\n### Monolithic Structure\n\n- Everything in a single package is known as monolithic\n- ![Monolithic Approach](/assets/images/2021-08-18-09-01-27.png)\n- Everything can access everything, and thus the high speed\n- But as everything is in a single file, it is difficult to maintain and modify\n\n### Layered Structure\n\n- ![Layered Approachs](/assets/images/2021-08-18-09-53-08.png)\n- OS Divided into a number of layers, each built on lower layers \n- Bottom layer is the hardware\n- Older Windows systems had this\n- ![OS on Layers](/assets/images/2021-08-18-09-06-28.png)\n\n### Microkernels\n\n- Most of the functions were moved from kernel to user space\n- Kernel now had:\n  - primitive memory management\n  - I/O and interrupt management\n  - Inter Process Communication\n  - Basic Scheduling\n- Other OS Services are provided by running in user mode\n- ![Microkernels](/assets/images/2021-08-18-09-10-30.png)\n- Advantages:\n  - You had to transfer the mode from user to kernel or vice-versa in the previous modes\n  - Communication takes place using message passing\n  - Easier to extend, as kernel mode is not to be chanced\n  - Easier to port the OS to new architecture (Only work on Kernel mode; user mode would be fine)\n  - More reliable (as less code in Kernel mode)\n  - More secure (as less code has to be validated in Kernel mode)\n- Disadvantages:\n  - Performance overhead of user to kernel communications\n- Mach, MINIX and Windows NT Client-Server are some examples\n  \n# Summary \n_Serial processing (Single job) - Simple batch system (Monitor acts as interaction) - User and Kernel mode of operation - Inefficiency of processing time is the issue of Simple Batch System - Uniprogrammin (Processor must wait for every job to complete) vs Multiprogramming (Processor runs Job B when during wait time of Job A) vs Time Sharing Systems (Processer divided among multiple users - Cloud System)_\n\n### [Lecture Recording](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JGyYxZy_zGdKeBffL52BtOTBVBz8I4bc&authuser=parth.s5%40ahduni.edu.in&usp=drive_fs)","url":"https://unread.parthshah.ml/notes\\DA5TzYNG4MEHUjowPx9Nz.html","relUrl":"notes\\DA5TzYNG4MEHUjowPx9Nz.html"},{"doc":"L1 -
