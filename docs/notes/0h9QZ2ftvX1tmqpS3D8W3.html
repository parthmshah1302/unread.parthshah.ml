<ol>
<li>
<p>If a friend of mine had a "personality conflict" with a mutual acquaintance of ours with whom
it was important for him/her to get along, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>4A. Tell my friend that I felt s/he was partially responsible for any problems with this
other person and try to let him/her know how the person was being affected by
him/her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1B. Not get involved because I wouldn't be able to continue to get along with both of
them once I had entered in any way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one of my friends and I had a heated argument in the past and I realized that s/he was ill at
ease around me from that time on, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>2A. Avoid making things worse by discussing his/her behavior and just let the whole
thing drop.</li>
<li>3B. Bring up his/her behavior and ask him/her how s/he felt the argument had affected
our relationship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a friend began to avoid me and act in an aloof and withdrawn manner, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>4A. Tell him/her about his/her behavior and suggest that s/he tell me what was on his/her
mind.</li>
<li>1B. Follow his/her lead and keep our contact brief and aloof since that seems to be what
s/he wants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If two of my friends and I were talking and one of my friends slipped and brought up a personal
problem of mine that involved the other friend, of which s/he was not yet aware, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>5A. Change the subject and signal my friend to do the same.</li>
<li>0B. Fill my uniformed friend in on what the other friend was talking about and suggest
that we go into it later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a friend of mine were to tell me that, in his/her opinion, I was doing things that made me
less effective than I might be in social situations, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>3A. Ask him/her to spell out or describe what s/he has observed and suggest changes I
might make.</li>
<li>2B. Resent his/her criticism and let him/her know why I behave the way I do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one of my friends aspired to an office in our organisation for which I felt s/he was unqualified, and
if s/he had been tentatively assigned to that position by the leader of our group, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>1A. Not mention my misgivings to either my friend or the leader of our group and let
them handle it in their own way.</li>
<li>4B. Tell my friend and the leader of our group of my misgivings and then leave the final
decision up to them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I felt that one of my friends was being unfair to me and his/her other friends, but none of
them had mentioned anything about it, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>3A. Ask several of these people how they perceived the situation to see if they felt s/he
was being unfair.</li>
<li>2B. Not ask the others how they perceived our friend, but wait for them to bring it up with
me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I were preoccupied with some personal matters and a friend told me that I had become irritated
with him/her and others and that I was jumping on him/her for unimportant things, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>5A. Tell him/her I was preoccupied and would probably be on edge for a while and would
prefer not to be bothered.</li>
<li>0B. Listen to his/her complaints but not try to explain my actions to him/her.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I had heard some friends discussing an ugly rumor about a friend of mine which I knew
could hurt him/her and s/he asked me what I knew about it, if anything, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>2A. Say I didn't know anything about it and tell him/her no one would believe a rumor
like that anyway.</li>
<li>3B. Tell him/her exactly what I had heard, when I had heard it, and from whom I had
heard it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a friend pointed out the fact that I had a personality conflict with another friend with whom
it was important for me to get along, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>0A. Consider his/her comments out of line and tell him/her I didn't want to discuss the
matter any further.</li>
<li>5B. Talk about it openly with him/her to find out how my behavior was being affected by
this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If my relationship with a friend has been damaged by repeated arguments on an issue
of importance to us both, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>0A. Be cautious in my conversations with him/her so the issue would not come up again
to worsen our relationship.</li>
<li>5B. Point to the problems the controversy was causing in our relationship and suggest that
we discuss it until we get it resolved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If in a personal discussion with a friend about his/her problems and behavior s/he
suddenly suggested we discuss my problems and behavior as well as his/her own, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>0A. Try to keep the discussion away from me by suggesting that other, closer friends
often talked to me about such matters.</li>
<li>5B. Welcome the opportunity to hear what s/he felt about me and encourage his/her
comments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a friend of mine began to tell me about his/her hostile feelings about another friend whom s/he
felt was being unkind to others (and I agreed wholeheartedly), I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>4A. Listen and also express my own feelings to me/her so s/he would know where I
stood.</li>
<li>1B. Listen, but not express my own negative views and opinion because s/he might repeat
what I said to him/her in confidence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I thought an ugly rumor was being spread about me and suspected that one of my friends had
quite likely heard it, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>3A. Avoid mentioning the issue and leave it to him/her to tell me about it if s/he wanted
to.</li>
<li>2B. Risk putting him/her on the spot by asking him/her directly what s/he knew about the
whole thing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I had observed a friend in social situations and thought that s/he was doing a number of
things which hurt his/her relationships, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>4A. Risk being seen as a busy body and tell him/her what I had observed and my
reactions to it.</li>
<li>1B. Keep my opinion to myself rather than be seen as interfering in things that are none
of my business.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If two friends and I were talking and one of them inadvertently mentioned a personal problem
which involved me, but of which I knew nothing, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>3A. Press them for information about the problem and their opinions about it.</li>
<li>2B. Leave it up to my friends to tell me or not tell me, letting them change the subject if
they wished.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a friend seemed to be preoccupied and began to jump on me for seemingly unimportant
things, and became irritated with me and others without real cause, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>3A. Treat him/her with kid gloves for awhile on the assumption that s/he was having
some temporary personal problems which were none of my business.</li>
<li>2B. Try to talk to him/her about it and point out to him/her how his/her behavior was
affecting people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I had begun to dislike certain habits of a friend to the point that it was interfering with
my enjoying his/her company, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>0A. Say nothing to him/her directly, but let him/her know my feelings by ignoring
him/her whenever his/her annoying habits were obvious.</li>
<li>5B. Get my feelings out in the open and clear the air so that we could continue our
friendship comfortably and enjoyably.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In discussing social behavior with one of my more sensitive friends, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>2A. Avoid mentioning his/her flaws and weaknesses so as not to hurt his/her feelings.</li>
<li>3B. Focus on his/her flaws and weaknesses so s/he could improve his/her interpersonal
skills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I knew I might be assigned to an important position in our group and my friends' attitudes
toward me had become rather negative, I would:</p>
<ul>
<li>1A. Discuss my shortcomings with my friends so I could see where to improve.</li>
<li>4B. Try to figure out my own shortcomings by myself so I could improve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
